# DX7

A passion for the Yamaha DX7 synth family (DX7, DX7 II) has lead us to asking many questions about what is possible. This is us spelunking deeper and deeper into the rabbithole.

## Projects

### [DX7 SysEx Datamoshing](./src/DX7-II-data-moshing/README.md)

### Livecoding Performance with DX7 Datamoshing

## Structure

### [doc](./doc/)

This repo includes documentation from Yamaha itself, as well as from other DX7 enthusiasts having already worked out many quirks and details deemed too cryptic to be understood from the original user manuals by us.

### [src](./src/)

It also has some code to interface with the DX7, mainly covering SysEx Patch experiments, as generating random ones to enforce sonic results no human would have ever naturally created by entering patch data with an interface.

### [tools](./tools/)

Scripts and such, helpful but not as feature complete as our code in src.

### [res](./res/)

To check our code we also need some resources, such as the original ROM cartridge SysEx dumps, or Scala tuning files.

## Thanks to

[SAM•ComputerStudio](https://hfm-karlsruhe.de/hochschule/einrichtungen/samcomputerstudio) at [HfM Karlsruhe](https://hfm-karlsruhe.de/) for giving us access to both a DX7 and a DX7 II•D, enabling us to become so infatuated with Yamaha's FM Synths.
